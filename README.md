# Web Music Player with Vue Powerd by Wavesurfer.js


I took my [Vue Music Player](https://uncleko.github.io/vue-music-player/) step further being integraded with [Wavesufer.js](https://wavesurfer-js.org/).

I made another repository instead of a branch to show both testing servers.

### Testing server is [Here](https://uncleko.github.io/vue-music-player-with-wavesurfer/).
[https://uncleko.github.io/vue-music-player-with-wavesurfer/](https://uncleko.github.io/vue-music-player-with-wavesurfer/)

There are some advantages and disadvantages.



## Advantages

- Looks Grate!!

- You can change the plyaing position by clickin on the waveforms. (I managed to work closely with the progress bars on the players).

## Disadvantages

- Takes some time to load the waveform.

- The need of using wavesurfer objects instead of HTML5 audio elemnets required more law javascript, ended up with less taking advantage of Vue.js 

- I haven't came up with the solution so far to pause/play by spacebar that I have in the version without wavesurfer.


## What is left

- The functionality of playing songs in a row automatically, or with the next/previous buttons.

## Upcoming 

- integrate with backednd (Laravel)

- categorize by genres and tags
